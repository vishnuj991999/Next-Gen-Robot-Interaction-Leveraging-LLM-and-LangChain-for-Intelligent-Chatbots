# Next-Gen-Robot-Interaction-Leveraging-LLM-and-LangChain-for-Intelligent-Chatbots

This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant trained on the content. The assistant answers questions based on the information it knows. If a question is outside the scope of the document, the AI will respond accordingly and attempt to provide a relevant answer.

## Features

- Chat interface to ask questions based on its knowledge.
- If the AI dont know the pretrained response, it provides a custom response.
- The assistant is implemented using the Together API with the `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo` model.
